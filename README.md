Hi Everyone, 

So, this is a lame application which calculates flames of two people.
F - Friends
L - Lovers
A - Aquaintances
M - Married
E - Enemies
S - Sister or Brother

This application follows the same algorithm to calculate flames as we did when we were kids (if you remember :P )
It works for both windows and linux. 

To run in windows
	1. Download flames1.xwindows.zip from https://github.com/learnability/hallows/
	2. Extract
	3. Double click on flames.exe file :D

To run on linux
	1. Download flames1.xlinux.tar.gz from https://github.com/learnability/hallows/
	2. Extract
	3. Open the terminal ( CTRL + ALT + T )
	4. Go inside the flames1.x directory (on the terminal) 
			cd flames1.x
	5. 		chmod 777 installdep.sh (on the terminal)
	6. 		./installdep.sh			(on the terminal)
	7. double click on executable named "flames" in flames1.x directory
	
And your work is done enjoy my lame game :D
